# My AI & Machine Learning Journey ðŸš€

## Welcome!
This repository serves as a personal journal and portfolio for my journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I created this space to apply the concepts I learn in a practical, hands-on way.

My goal is to build a collection of small-scale projects, each one tackling a different problem and demonstrating a new skill. This is a learn-by-doing approach, and I believe it's the best way to solidify my understanding of the entire ML workflow, from data cleaning and analysis to model training and evaluation.
